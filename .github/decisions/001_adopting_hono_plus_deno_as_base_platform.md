**Title:** Adopting Hono with Deno as the base platform

### Summary:
This document outlines the decision to use Hono with Deno as the web framework stack for the project, reversing the previous consideration of Laravel. The combination of Hono and Deno provides a modern, type-safe, and performant foundation for web development.

### Description:
After careful evaluation of various options, Hono with Deno emerged as the optimal choice for our web framework stack. This decision was driven by several key factors:

* **Native TypeScript Support:** Deno's built-in TypeScript support eliminates the need for additional configuration and tooling, providing a cleaner development experience.
* **Modern Runtime:** Deno offers improved security, better performance, and a more streamlined development experience compared to traditional Node.js.
* **Lightweight and Flexible:** Hono's minimal footprint and high performance make it ideal for building efficient web applications.
* **Cross-Runtime Compatibility:** Hono's ability to run on multiple platforms (Deno, Node.js, Bun, Cloudflare Workers) provides flexibility for future deployment options.
* **Web Standard APIs:** Deno's use of web standard APIs reduces the learning curve and improves code portability.
* **Built-in Security:** Deno's security-first approach with explicit permissions enhances application security.

### Alternatives Considered:
* **Laravel:** Initially considered for its comprehensive feature set, but deemed overly complex for our needs. The overhead of PHP and its ecosystem was unnecessary for our use case.
* **Express.js:** A mature Node.js framework, but lacks native TypeScript support and modern features that Deno provides.
* **Fastify:** While performant, it still relies on Node.js and requires additional setup for TypeScript support.

The combination of Hono and Deno was chosen because it offers:
* Native TypeScript support
* Modern runtime features
* Minimal overhead
* Excellent performance
* Clean architecture without legacy compromises
* Strong security model

### Impact:
Adopting Hono with Deno is expected to:
* Improve development efficiency through better TypeScript integration
* Reduce deployment complexity with Deno's single executable
* Enhance application security through Deno's permission system
* Provide better performance compared to traditional Node.js-based solutions
* Simplify dependency management with Deno's built-in package handling
* Enable easier maintenance due to cleaner architecture and less boilerplate
